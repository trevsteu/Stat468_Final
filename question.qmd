## Approach

Depending on the context, there can be countless approaches one could take to estimate $v_i$, the value of the $i^{\text{th}}$ selection of an NHL Entry Draft. As one example, one could estimate $v_i$ by comparing the assets given up and acquired to previous trades and obtain the "market value" of each selection. In contrast, this report will take the approach of defining the value of selection $i$ to be the career contribution of the player drafted at $i^{\text{th}}$ overall in the upcoming draft. This report will estimate value of pick $i$ (ie find $\hat v_i$) by fitting several models incorperating the PSs by the players previously selected at pick $i$ (and possibly selections "close" to $n$). We will consider two different methods of expressing our data, and for each we will fit a linear regression model, weighted $k$-nearest neighbour algorithm, and a non-linear regression model. To maintain some consistency with previous related work, this report will define $v_i$ to be "true" value of the $i^{\text{th}}$ selection, and this value will be in terms of unitless "points", which are aimed at making comparing the value of picks easier. That is, instead of saying $v_i = \frac{a}{b} v_1$ for $i > 1$ where $a < b$, we will say $v_1 \approx 1000$ points, \$v_i = c\$ points for $1000 < c < 0$.

There are critical points that must be mentioned in relation to the models that we will fit. First, clearly we must have that $v_i > v_{i+k}$ for all $k \in \mathbb Z^+$, so that later draft picks are not considered more valuable than picks earlier in the draft. This should intuitively make sense because the players available at pick $i+k$ are a proper subset of the players available at pick $i$, so there is no reason for a later pick to be more valuable in a trade context than an earlier pick. Thus for a model to have any chance of being accurate, it must satisfy $v_i > v_{i+k}$ for all $k \in \mathbb Z^+$. The second important note is that it is common knowledge in ice hockey circles and confirmed by the previous work listed below is that NHL draft picks do [**not**]{.underline} decrease in value linearly. In particular, $v_i$ decreases quickly in $i$, so the difference in value pick 1 and 30 is much greater than between pick 101 and 130 (ie $v_1 - v_{30} >>> v_{101} - v_{130}$).

Note that if picks did decrease linearly in value linearly then it would be very easy to create a model of draft pick value since we would have

$$ v_1 = v_2 + c = v_3 + 2c = ... = v_{224} + 223c $$where $c > 0$, meaning we would only have to find the value of $c$. Note that in the model step we will fit this model and perform a statistical test to show that this model is not appropriate, before quickly moving on to non-linear models.

## Previous Work

Some work in this area has been done before, such as:

-   [Valuation of NHL Draft Picks using Functional Data Analysis](https://summit.sfu.ca/_flysystem/fedora/2023-02/etd22223.pdf)

-   [Examining the value of NHL Draft picks](https://soundofhockey.com/2022/06/06/examining-the-value-of-nhl-draft-picks/amp/)

-   [NHL draft: What does it cost to trade up?](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/post/nhl-draft-pick-value-trading-up/)

This report will most closely follow the work done in the first paper listed. As an interesting aside, Eric Tulsky, who wrote the last article listed above in 2013, was hired as General Manager of the Carolina Hurricanes in 2024.
