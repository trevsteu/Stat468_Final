## Approach

Depending on the context, there can be countless approaches one could take to define the relative value of each selection of an NHL Entry Draft. As one example, one could look at prior trades and then define the value of a pick to be what it has historically been traded for (the "market rate"), as was done by [Isack (2022)](https://soundofhockey.com/2022/06/06/examining-the-value-of-nhl-draft-picks/) and [Tulsky (2013)](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/post/nhl-draft-pick-value-trading-up/). For example, this approach might say that pick $i$ is typically traded for pick $j$ and pick $k$. In contrast, this report will take the approach of defining the value of selection $i$ to be the career contribution of the player drafted at $i^{\text{th}}$ overall. This matches the definition chosen by [Moreau (2020)](https://summit.sfu.ca/_flysystem/fedora/2023-02/etd22223.pdf), and it is preferred in this context because we wish to find opportunities for general managers to make trades that help their team get a higher (expected)

This report will estimate value of pick $i$ (ie find $\hat v_i$) by fitting several models incorporating the PS and GP data by the players previously selected at pick $i$ (and the selections "close" to $n$). We will consider two different methods of measuring the quality of a player (and thus the quality of a pick), and for each we will fit a linear and non-linear regression model.

The first two methods of evaluating player quality are similar to approaches taken by Moreau (2022), and will take the average PS (or GP) of all players taken at pick $i$. Next, will consider a similar metric which adjusts the PS values for active players based on what we estimate their PS will be in the remainder of their career. The final approach is from Luo (2024) and will define an indicator random variable $Z_{ij} = 1$ iff the player selected at pick $i$ of draft $j$ has played or will play in 200 career NHL games. We then take the average value of this indicator for each $i$, which will be our estimate of the probability that a player selected at pick $i$ will play in 200 NHL games. Thus in total we have four measures of the quality of players drafted at pick $i$ (mean PS, mean GP, adjusted mean PS, and mean proportion of players who play in $\ge$ 200 games.

To maintain some consistency with previous related work, this report will define $v_i$ to be "true" value of the $i^{\text{th}}$ selection, and this value will be in terms of unitless "points", which are aimed at making comparing the value of picks easier. That is, instead of saying $v_i = \frac{a}{b} v_1$ for $i > 1$ where $a < b$, we will say $v_1 \approx 1000$ points, $v_i = c$ points for $0 < c < 1000$.

## Considerations

We will fit 12 models in the Model chapter, so we need some criteria for what a feasible model looks like. The following are basic rules to make sure our model has the potential of being good.

-   Clearly we must have that $v_i > v_{i+k}$ for all $i, k \in \mathbb Z^+$, so that later draft picks are not considered more valuable than picks earlier in the draft. This should intuitively make sense because the players available at pick $i+k$ are a proper subset of the players available at pick $i$, so there is no reason for a later pick to be more valuable in a trade context than an earlier pick. Thus for a model to have any chance of being accurate, it must satisfy $v_i > v_{i+k}$ for all $k \in \mathbb Z^+$.

-   $v_i > 0$ for all $i$. That is, every pick is worth a positive number of points, since there is no real negative impact to picking a bad player (other than the opportunity cost of the "wasted" draft pick).

-   It is common knowledge in ice hockey circles and confirmed by the previous work listed below is that NHL draft picks do [**not**]{.underline} decrease in value linearly. In particular, $v_i$ decreases quickly in $i$, so the difference in value pick 1 and 30 is much greater than between pick 101 and 130 (ie $v_1 - v_{30} >>> v_{101} - v_{130}$). In the Model chapter we will fit this model and perform a statistical test to show that this model is not appropriate, before quickly moving on to non-linear models.

Note that if picks did decrease linearly in value linearly then it would be very easy to create a model of draft pick value since we would have

$$ v_1 = v_2 + c = v_3 + 2c = ... = v_{224} + 223c $$where $c > 0$, meaning we would only have to find the value of $c$.

## Previous Work

Some work in this area has been done before, such as:

-   [Valuation of NHL Draft Picks using Functional Data Analysis](https://summit.sfu.ca/_flysystem/fedora/2023-02/etd22223.pdf)

-   [Improving NHL Draft Outcome Predictions using Scouting Reports](https://hluo27.github.io/assets/files/NHL_Draft_Scouting_Reports.pdf)

-   [Examining the value of NHL Draft picks](https://soundofhockey.com/2022/06/06/examining-the-value-of-nhl-draft-picks/amp/)

-   [NHL draft: What does it cost to trade up?](https://www.broadstreethockey.com/post/nhl-draft-pick-value-trading-up/)

This report will most closely follow the work done in the first two papers listed. As an interesting aside, Eric Tulsky, who wrote the last article listed above in 2013, was hired as General Manager of the Carolina Hurricanes in 2024.
