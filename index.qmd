# Introduction

## Abstract

In the days of and leading up to the 2025 NHL Entry Draft there were a total of 18 trades which only included draft picks. This report aims to use player contribution data to determine the relative value of selections in the NHL Entry Draft. To do this, data will be imported from [Hockey Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/), and a weighted $k$-nearest neighbours algorithm will be used to predict the value of each pick based on historical outcomes. Knowing the relative value of picks allows NHL teams to both determine whether they should accept trade offers they have received as well as propose favourable trades to other teams. The RShiny app component of this project will allow users to interactively check the fairness of potential trades.

## Data

The data used by this report is imported from [Hockey Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/), which has data on the NHL Draft and player games played and point share counts dating back to 1963, though we will only use a subset of this data as will be explained later. Each row on Hockey Reference is one player selected, and the columns included on the site are:

-   `Overall`: the selection mumber where the player was selected.
-   `Team`: the team that selected the player.
-   `Name`, `Nat`, `Pos`, `Age`: the player's name, nationality, position, at age at the time of the draft.
-   `To`: the last year a player played in the NHL. For players who never played in the NHL this will be the empty string, for those who are still playing it will be `2025`.
-   `Amateur Team`: the team the player was drafted from (confusingly this could be a pro European team).
-   `GP`, `G`, `A`, `PTS`, `+/-`, `PIM`: the player's career games played, goals, assists, points (goals plus assists), plus minus, and penalty minutes. For players who never played in the NHL this will be the empty string.
-   `GP`, `W`, `L`, `T/O`, `SV%`, `GAA`: the goalie's career games played, wins, losses, ties plus overtime losses, save percentage, and goals against average. For skater and goalies who never played in the NHL all of these columns will be the empty string.
-   `PS`: the player's estimated point share, or career points added to their team (here we mean points in the standings, not goals and assists). There is more info on point share [here](https://www.hockey-reference.com/about/point_shares.html).

Note that we will only use a subset of these columns, as will be explained in the [Tidy chapter](https://trevsteu.github.io/Stat468_Final/tidy.html).

## Constraints

There are a number of technical and practical constraints at play. Here are some of them:

-   There have only been 63 drafts in NHL history, but drafts which occurred too long ago are likely not relevant and drafts which occurred too recently are difficult to evaluate. This will be discussed further in the [Import chapter](https://trevsteu.github.io/Stat468_Final/import.html).

-   Players drafted earlier in a draft (ie with a better pick) typically get more opportunities than players selected in the later rounds. In particular, teams often fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy because scouts and management look bad when players who they invested a high pick into don't contribute to the team. This is very difficult to account for, and we will not attempt to remedy it.

-   Estimating the value of a player's career is not a trivial task. We will use point shares and games played, but these are not perfect metrics as they can still be dependent on external factors, such as the quality of the player's team the opportunities the player was given.

-   Additionally, the value of the pick from the team's perspective depends on how long the player stayed on their team and what (if anything) the team got when the player left the team (via trade, free agency, or retirement). We will ignore this because it is nearly impossible to take these factors into account.

-   Every draft has strong portions and weak portions. For example, one draft might have a very strong second round (by that we mean the prospects drafted in the second round in that particular draft are of higher quality than those typically drafted in the second round). Though this seems like an obvious point, it is crucial to mention because it is a significant asterisk on this report, which will assume all drafts have equal value structures (ie the quality of a prospect #27 overall of draft A is the same as the quality of a prospect drafted at \# 27 of draft B)
