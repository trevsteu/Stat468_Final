<p>The first two metrics we will fit models to are GP and PS, in the Transform chapter, we will create the other two metrics which we will base our model off of.</p>
<p>The first transformation we will make in this chapter is to adjust our PS to better represent the careers of active players (ie those who have not retired yet). Recall that in the Visualize chapter we looked at the average PS of all players in out dataset drafted at pick <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. As mentioned in the constraints section, one problem with this approach is that players drafted more recently will have had fewer years to generate PS. Figure 6.2.1 shows that, unsurprisingly, the total PS is quite a bit lower for the drafts between 2016 and 2020:</p>

<p>Considering this, it makes sense to make an adjustment to active players based on an estimate of the PS they will generate in the remainder of their career.</p>
<p>The other transformation we make in this chapter is to implement the method taken by <span class="citation" data-cites="luo_improving_2024">Luo (<a href="#ref-luo_improving_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> which is to define a draft pick to be a “success” if that prospect becomes an NHL regular, which is defined to be playing in <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 200 NHL games for skaters. We will then fit a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of a player selected with pick <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> becoming a regular NHL player. Note that <span class="citation" data-cites="luo_improving_2024">Luo (<a href="#ref-luo_improving_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> using this definition for different analysis (he was evaluating prospect quality to better evaluate prospects, not value draft picks), but the applications are close enough and so we should be able to use his definition without any issues.</p>

<p>A similar issue to the one raised above is that there are quite a few players in our dataset who can still generate additional PS because they haven’t retired. These two issues are related as it is probably reasonable to expect that the discrepancy between the 2016-2020 PS totals and the other years is at least partially due to there being so many active players who were drafted in that time frame. Indeed, we can see in Figure 6.3.1.1 that there are still a large number of active players from around the 2010 draft onward.</p>

<p>We can see that our dataset has quite a few active players, and the full value of these players’ careers cannot be fully known. As an aside, it is interesting that PS is so high for the drafts between 2010 and 2015 even though there are still so many active players from those drafts. The 2015 draft is widely considered to be on of the best drafts ever, which explains why it does not follow the general decreasing trend after 2014, but this does not explain why the other drafts were so high. I guess it is possible the drafts between 2010 and 2014 were also really strong drafts, but it seems odd that there would be 6 strong drafts in a row. I did a little bit of research but couldn’t find anything about it. It certainly appears that players drafted in more recent draft classes tend to produce less PS, which will give them less weight when we fit out regression models. We have three options</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only include drafts from before 2003 (there are no active NHL players who were drafted in 2002 or earlier).</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore this issue altogether (as if every active player in our dataset retired right now).</p></li>
<li><p>Make some sort of adjustment to the PS values of active players to account for the remainder of their career.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Neither of the first two options are particularly appealing. The first is unideal because of sample size concerns and the changes that have taken place in terms of draft eligibility and strategy since the 1980s (which we would need to include to maintain a sample size of 25). The second option is also not great because it will severely underestimate the quality of star players drafted in the last few years (elite players can play for 15-20 seasons, so we could be missing three quarters of a player’s career if he was drafted in 2020). Thus we will attempt to estimate the remaining value of a player’s career.</p>
<p>Estimating the remaining value of a player’s career could be an entire project all on its own, so we will not go too into too much detail here. That being said, the adjustment we are about to make should reduce the amount that our model underestimates players who were drafted recently (while acknowledging that we will not completely fix it). Let <span class="math inline">\(gp_{i,j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ps_{i,j}\)</span> be the GP and PS of the player drafted at pick <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of draft <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. If the player is retired, then no adjustment is required, so we set <span class="math inline">\(ps_{i,j}^{adj} = ps_{i,j}\)</span>. If that player is active, we will set <span class="math inline">\(ps^{adj}_{i,j} = ps_{i,j} + \frac{ps_{i,j}}{gp_{i,j}} \times \hat gr_{i,j}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\hat gr_{i,j}\)</span> is our <u><strong>estimate</strong></u> of the number of games left in the career the player. We will set <span class="math inline">\(\hat gr_{i,j} = \frac{gp_{i,j}}{years_{j}} \cdot \hat yr_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(years_{j}\)</span> is the number of years since players from draft <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> were drafted and <span class="math inline">\(\hat yr_j\)</span> is the estimated number of years left in the career of all players drafted in year <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. In other words, the estimated number of games remaining in a player’s career is their average number of games per season times the estimated number of years remaining. Simplifying, we have <span class="math inline">\(ps_{i,j}^{adj} = ps_{i,j} + \frac{ps_{i,j}}{years_{j}} \cdot\hat{yr_{j}}\)</span>. We will estimate <span class="math inline">\(yr_j\)</span> using data from 1996-2004 since almost all the players drafted between these years are retired. When we code this adjustment later in this chapter, we will verify that the PS values of drafts with a large number of active players end up looking similar to drafts where everyone is retired.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(yr_j\)</span> be the number of years players drafted in draft <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> have remaining in their career, given they were drafted <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> years ago. We aim to estimate this value, and will do so by setting <span class="math inline">\(\hat yr_j\)</span> to be the mean career length of players were drafted between 1996 and 2004 AND played in at least <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> seasons. We calculate it for <span class="math inline">\(1 \le k \le 22\)</span> to make the indexing more intuitive, even though we will only be using the values <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 5\)</span>, since no active player drafted in 2020 or earlier can have played for less than 4 seasons. We calculate <span class="math inline">\(\hat yr_j\)</span> and then present it in graphical form (Figure 6.3.2.1) and in table form (Table 6.3.2.2).</p>

<p>The correct interpretation of these estimates is that a current NHL player who was drafted 1 year ago has an estimated 9.478 years left in their career, a current NHL player who was drafted 5 years ago has an estimated 6.475 years left in their career, and on.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adjusting-ps-values"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> Adjusting PS Values</h3>
<p>Now that we have estimated the remaining number of years for each active NHL player, we can estimate the total PS for their career. Recall that in the introduction of this chapter we said <span class="math inline">\(ps_{i,j}^{adj} = ps_{i,j} + \frac{ps_{i,j}}{years_{j}} \cdot\hat{yr_{i,j}}\)</span>. We make this adjustment and then produce Table 6.3.3.1, which has the PS and adjusted PS values</p>

<p>Table 6.3.3.1: Data with Adjusted PS values</p>
<p>Note that the adjusted PS values for players who are expected to retire soon may not have changed much, if at all. To say it again, this estimate is not perfect, but it is better than the alternatives (using older data or ignoring the issue). In particular, this method assumes all players will continue to generate PS and play in games at the same rate as they have to this point in their career, and that the number of additional years a player will play for only depends on how many years ago they were drafted.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-our-adjustment"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.4</span> Evaluating our Adjustment</h3>
<p>We can do some checks to see if these estimates seem reasonable. First, we look at a plot of the PS values before and after the adjustment. We will plot all years for sake of comparison, but recall we only made changes for active players, and thus the drafts between 1996 and 2002 were completely unaffected (and thus the PS and adjusted PS points are on top of each other):</p>

<p>It seems our adjustment was worthwhile since we can see in Figure 6.3.4.1 that the drafts after 2010 (which are the drafts with a large number of active players) saw their PS values go up substantially.</p>
<p>Next, we check the magnitude of our changes by calculating the mean and standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,j}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j \in \{ 1996, ..., 2004\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,j}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j \in \{ 2012, ..., 2020 \}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,j}^{adj}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j \in \{ 2012, ..., 2020\}\)</span>. Note that the intervals are the same size and that the first interval is years where almost all players have retired, and the second interval contains years which had their PS values were more heavily adjusted.</p>

<p>Our adjustment looks quite good since the mean and standard deviation of the first and third sets seem close, indicating the adjusted PS values for drafts we adjusted “look like” the true PS values. Additionally, the first and second sets look quite different, suggesting that the adjustment we made was necessary.</p>
<p>Another way we can check if the adjusted drafts seem similar to the drafts which required little adjustment is by comparing a histogram of the drafts between 1996 and 200 with the drafts between 2016 and 2020. Of course, we’re not expecting them to be perfectly identical because there is a fair amount of variation even between drafts that required little to no adjustment (for example 1999 and 2003 are quite different in Figure 6.2.1).</p>

<p>The values in Figure 6.3.4.2 are a bit hard to compare because the tail gets so small so fast, but the values close to 0 look similar enough. We can zoom in on the tail, note that there isn’t much to look at after 100:</p>

<p>There seem to be a similar number of observations in each bin, so it seems like our estimations are reasonable. Note again that we are clear restrictions and potential sources of error with this approach, and in the Model chapter we will fit a model using both the raw PS values and the adjusted PS values. Before moving on to the next section of this chapter, we create a plot of the mean PS and adjusted PS values, which is the same as the last plot from the Visualize chapter, except we will be including the adjusted PS values. This plot is given below in Figure 6.3.4.4.</p>

<p>As we can see in Figure 6.3.4.4, the mean Adjusted PS values are all are greater than or equal to the mean unadjusted PS values, which is to be expected what we would expect because <span class="math inline">\(ps^{adj}_{i,j} \ge ps_{i,j}\)</span>, we add PS to players who are still active NHL players and do not change the PS values of retired players. Adjusted PS is the third of the four metrics we will use in the Model chapter, though note that we we will use the raw adjusted PS values rather than the aggregated values.</p>

<p>In this section we will add a column our dataset indicating whether the player became or is on track to become an NHL regular. We will adopt the same definition as <span class="citation" data-cites="luo_improving_2024">Luo (<a href="#ref-luo_improving_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, which is that a player is an NHL regular if they are a skater who played in, or is on track to play in, 200 NHL games. This is straightforward a player is retired or has already played in enough games, but is more complex if the player is active and has not yet reached the required number of games. For these players, we will take an almost identical approach as <span class="citation" data-cites="luo_improving_2024">Luo (<a href="#ref-luo_improving_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, which changes the GP threshold depending on when a player was drafted. The modified threshold for skaters is given below, where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is the year the player was drafted in, and <span class="math inline">\(t_j\)</span> is the threshold for players drafted in year <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t_j = \begin{cases}200 \text{,                if $j \le 2017$}\\ \frac{82\times(2025-j)}{3} \text{,    if $j \in \{ 2018, 2019, 2020 \}$}\\ \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Luo did not consider goalies at all in his paper, so one of the changes we will make from Luo’s equation is that the threshold for goalies will be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{t_j}{2}\)</span> because goalies take longer to develop and even the best goalies only play in at most 75% of their teams’ games. Thus 100 games for a goalie is around 2.5 seasons’ worth, which is roughly equivalent to 200 games for a skater.</p>

<p>Figure 6.4.2.1 includes a plot of the skater GP thresholds based on the skater’s draft year. This information is also presented in table form in Table 6.4.2.2. Note that we don’t care what the threshold is for player’s drafted after 2020 because those players are not in our dataset. The only other difference between our threshold is Luo’s is that the years are different, since Luo’s work is from a year ago and used data from slightly different years. Note that Luo did some checks to make sure this estimate is appropriate, it turned out to be quite a good predictor of whether a player will play in 200 games.</p>

<p>We have now added the column necessary to create a model based on whether an NHL player became an NHL regular. We won’t use the aggregated values to fit a model, but to see if this metric has potential we aggregate the data to get the average rate at which every pick becomes an NHL regular and then plot it to ensure the rate generally decreases ad the draft goes on. We also jitter the data vertically to make the plot more readable.</p>

<p>Figure 6.4.2.1 has a similar shape to the plots at the end of the Visualize chapter. We will use the raw <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> values to fit a logistic regression model in the Model chapter.</p>

<p>Now that we have the metrics we will use in the Model chapter, we will combine them into a single data frame to make the modelling as straightforward as possible. We also make a plot of the average values by pick each metric in Figure 6.5.1, note that no points can be directly on top of each other because all points have different <code>overall</code> values, but the plot of sis once again jittered vertically. We would probably prefer to plot these curves on the same plot, but their scales are completely different so this would be meaningless.

<p>The plots in Figure 6.5.1 all have the same general shape, though some of them are on different scales. In the Model chapter, we will fit a model to the raw data, put the models on the same scale, and evaluate the models.</p>

<p>As touched on at the very end of the Tidy chapter, we will be storing our data frames in an S3 bucket. We use the same code to add <code>all_data_adj</code> and <code>all_data_comb</code> to our S3 bucket within AWS. In <code>function.R</code> we get these data frames by querying the S3 bucket using duckdb. This code isn’t functional anymore, so we redo it with csv files.</p>
