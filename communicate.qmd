This is a placeholder for my communicate chapter and will eventually have plots, tables, etc.

This chapter will contain my table, graph, value + pick functions, and instructions for and a link to my shiny app. In my RShiny app, I plan to allow users to enter potential trades, click "evaluate", and then see the point gain/loss. Additionally, I'd like to put the point difference into context "this is equivalent to team A giving up the 174th overall pick".

Other things I need to do:

-   Read thru instructions to see if I'm missing anything

-   Give all plots titles and labels

-   Remove unnecessary library calls

-   Make sure everything flows logically

-   Make notation consistent

-   make sure links work

-   Make code more efficient

-   Spell check

-   Add references to .bib file

-   remove unnecessary files from github (ie holding_file, model2, etc).
