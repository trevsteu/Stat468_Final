This is a placeholder for my communicate chapter and will eventually have plots, tables, etc.

In my RShiny app, I plan to allow users to enter potental trades, click "evaluate", and then see the point gain/loss. Additionally, I'd like to put the point difference into context "this is equivalent to team A giving up the 174th overall pick".
